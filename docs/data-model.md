# Data model & access rules

The schema is Go-as-code in `migrations/`. `1800000000_init.go` creates every
collection and sets the baseline access rules; later timestamped migrations
amend specific pieces. This doc is the human-readable summary — the
migrations are the source of truth.

Tenancy is **plain PocketBase collection rules**, not pb-tenancy. Every rule
is built from four constants in `internal/authz`:

| Constant        | Expands to                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `StaffRule`     | `@request.auth.collectionName = 'staff'`                       |
| `AdminRule`     | `StaffRule && @request.auth.role = 'admin'`                    |
| `RequesterRule` | `@request.auth.collectionName = 'users'`                       |

The whole security model reduces to: **staff see everything; a requester sees
only their own company's non-internal data.**

## Identity: two auth collections

Requests are attributed to one of two auth collections, distinguished in
rules by `@request.auth.collectionName`.

- **`staff`** — agents and admins, cross-customer. Fields: `name`, `role`
  (`agent` | `admin`), `active`, `avatar` (single image, optional —
  migration `1807000000`). `AuthRule: active = true`. Any staff member
  can read the roster (needed for assignee pickers); only admins
  create/delete. A staff member may self-update profile fields (`name`,
  `avatar`) but cannot change their own `role` or `active` (blocked by an
  `:isset` body guard).
- **`users`** — requesters (the repurposed default PB collection), scoped to
  one customer. Fields: `customer` (relation, **required**), `active`,
  `avatar` (single image, optional). `AuthRule: active = true && customer != ''`.
  A requester sees only themselves in the collection; only admins
  create/delete; self-update cannot reassign `customer` or toggle `active`.
  Also carries `phone` (added `1812000000`) — the requester's direct line,
  self-editable in the profile modal; the number a dispatcher/tech calls.

Both collections stamp `emailVisibility = true` on create
(`internal/authfix`) — PB hides emails by default, which would break the
staff roster and pickers.

## Data collections

### `customers` — the company directory

`name` (unique), `active`, `platform_org_id` (unique when set — maps a
customer to the NATS subject org token), `webhook_token` (hidden; the inbound
webhook secret), `email_domain` (optional, unique when set, added `1823000000` —
the customer's own mail domain, used to route inbound email from an unregistered
sender to this tenant; normalized and blocked from shared providers like
gmail.com by `internal/customers`), `notes`, `show_time_to_requester` (bool,
default false — added `1810000000`).

Rules: read `StaffRule`; create/update/delete `AdminRule`. `webhook_token` is
a hidden field — it never leaves the server via the record API; staff reveal
or rotate it through `POST /api/helpdesk/customers/{id}/webhook-token`.

`show_time_to_requester` is a per-customer opt-in (default off) that lets the
portal show the **aggregate** time logged on that customer's tickets — never
the per-entry rows. It gates the `GET /api/helpdesk/tickets/{id}/time-total`
route (`internal/timeentries`): staff always get the full total, a requester
only for their own customer's ticket and only when the flag is on — and the
requester's figure is **billable-only** (entries flagged `non_billable` are
excluded), so what the customer sees matches what they'd be invoiced. Off by
default because exposing hours is an MSP billing-model choice and hard to walk
back.

### `tickets` — the unit of work

`number` (unique int, assigned by the create hook), `customer` (required),
`title`, `body`, `status` (`open` | `in_progress` | `waiting` | `resolved` |
`closed`), `priority` (`low` | `normal` | `high` | `urgent`), `assignee`
(→ staff), `requester` (→ users, optional — machine tickets have none),
`source` (`portal` | `agent` | `nats` | `webhook` | `email`; `email` added
`1823000000`), `origin_subject` (the full hub-side NATS subject, provenance for
machine tickets), `dedupe_key` (unique when set — ingestion idempotency, also
carries the inbound email `Message-ID`), `attachments` (≤6 files),
`category` (→ ticket_categories, optional — see below), `type` (`issue` |
`install`, default `issue` via the create hook — reactive vs. planned work),
`project` (→ projects, optional — groups install/reactive work), `asset`
(free text), `location` (→ locations, optional — the structured place, and
the reporting axis), `location_note` (free text — dispatch hints, or the
unmatched-code fallback from machine intake). All added/changed `1812000000`.
`estimated_minutes` (int ≥ 1, optional — staff effort estimate, added
`1815000000`; compared against the logged `time_entries` total per ticket and
summed per project at read time — see `projects`). Distinct from
`visits.duration_minutes` (a *calendar block*, not an *effort estimate*).
`awaiting_requester` (bool, added `1818000000`) — a queryable flag maintained by
`internal/tickets` backing the portal's "needs your reply" prompt / list chip /
dashboard tile. Staff-explicit: set only when a public staff comment ticks
*Request a reply* (`ticket_comments.requests_reply`, `1819000000`), cleared on a
requester reply or on resolve/close. `install` tickets are excluded. Not a
source of truth. `resolved_at` (datetime, optional, added `1821000000`) — stamped
by the `internal/tickets` guard when the ticket enters `resolved`, cleared when
it leaves (mirrors visits' `completed_at`); it gives the auto-close cron a
trustworthy age. Nil unless currently resolved.

**Two-stage terminal.** `resolved` and `closed` are *not* synonyms: `resolved`
is a grace window (a requester comment reopens it), `closed` is final (requesters
can't comment — see `ticket_comments` below — and a reply never reopens). A daily
cron (`tickets.AutoCloseResolved`, wired in `cmd/helpdesk`) promotes tickets left
`resolved` past `auto_close_resolved_days` (config, default 7; `0` disables) to
`closed`, suppressing the mail. Both still read as inactive in every "active"
query (`status != 'resolved' && status != 'closed'`), so the split left the
queues untouched. `waiting` remains an agent-set "blocked on a third party"
status, orthogonal to `awaiting_requester`.

Rules:

- **read** — `StaffRule || (RequesterRule && customer = @request.auth.customer)`.
  A requester sees only their own company's tickets.
- **create** — staff freely; a requester only for their own customer, with
  `requester` = themselves, no `assignee`, `source = 'portal'`, and none of
  `category` / `type` / `project` / `location` / `estimated_minutes` (all
  pinned in the create rule so the portal can't forge them — classification,
  the service-delivery fields, and the effort estimate are staff actions).
- **update** — `StaffRule`. Requesters never edit ticket fields; they act
  through comments.
- **delete** — `AdminRule`.

### `ticket_categories` — classification (added `1806000000`)

Admin-managed list of what tickets are about: `name` (unique), `key` (unique
slug — the stable handle used in queue filters and machine payloads, so
renaming `name` never breaks them), `active` (retire without deleting
history), `sort_order`, `color` (hex, rendered as a soft badge).

A managed collection + relation rather than a `select` field because it is
staff/admin-managed from the SPA: admins add/retire categories with no code
deploy, renames touch one row (a select denormalizes the value onto every
ticket), and it matches the app's grain. `asset` stays free text
(**not** a CMDB — no device catalog); `location` was promoted to a relation
(see `locations` below) once projects made physical places recur, but it stays
a light place registry, not an asset catalog.

Rules: read `StaffRule || RequesterRule` (staff use it for the picker;
requesters read it so a ticket's category **badge** resolves portal-side —
opened by `1808000000`; the taxonomy is non-sensitive labels);
create/update/delete `AdminRule`.

### `ticket_comments` — the thread

`ticket` (required, cascade-delete), `author_staff` **or** `author_user`
(exactly one, matching the author's class), `body`, `internal` (bool —
staff-only working notes), `attachments` (≤6 files), `source_message_id`
(hidden text, unique when set, added `1823000000` — the inbound email
`Message-ID`, so a redelivered reply can't post a duplicate comment; empty for
UI/portal comments).

Rules:

- **read** — `StaffRule || (RequesterRule && ticket.customer =
  @request.auth.customer && internal = false)`. Internal notes never reach
  the portal, and attachments on them inherit that (PB gates file access by
  the record's view rule).
- **create** — staff set `author_staff` = themselves; a requester sets
  `author_user` = themselves, on their own company's ticket, and cannot set
  `internal` (guarded with `:isset`). A requester also **can't comment on a
  `closed` ticket** (`@request.body.ticket.status != 'closed'`, amended by
  `1822000000`) — closed is final, a follow-up is a new ticket. Staff can still
  comment on closed tickets (their branch is unguarded).
- **update/delete** — `AdminRule`.

### `ticket_events` — the audit trail (added `1805000000`)

One row per workflow-field change: `ticket` (cascade), `field`, `old_value`,
`new_value` (stored already human-readable), `actor_staff` / `actor_user`,
`created`. Written by `internal/activity`. Audited fields: `status`,
`priority`, `assignee` plus the classification/grouping fields `category`,
`type`, `project`, `location` — relation values resolve to a label at write
time (category/location name, project `#N Title`).

Rules: read `StaffRule || (RequesterRule && field = 'status' &&
ticket.customer = @request.auth.customer)` — staff see the whole trail;
requesters see only **status** transitions on their own tickets, for the
portal progress timeline (amended by `1808000000`). All other events —
priority/assignee (staff names — the roster we hide) and the newer
category/type/project/location — never match, and the
actor relations stay staff-gated so an actor expand is dropped for a
requester. No create/update/delete API rule — only the server hooks write
here, via `app.Save`, which bypasses collection rules, so the trail can't be
forged through the API.

### `time_entries` — labor log

`ticket` (cascade), `staff` (required), `minutes` (int ≥ 1), `work_date`,
`note`, `visit` (→ visits, optional — added `1809000000`), `non_billable`
(bool, default false — added `1820000000`).

The ticket is the **canonical labor ledger**: `ticket` is required, so the
ticket total is always `sum(minutes)` filtered by ticket. `visit` is an
optional *dimension* on an entry — presence marks it as on-site/field time and
enables per-visit and field-vs-desk subtotals with no rollup machinery. No
cascade on the visit FK: deleting a visit never deletes labor (the entry keeps
its ticket; the dangling visit ref resolves to nothing).

`non_billable` marks labor not to be invoiced (rework, goodwill). It is stored
as the **exception** rather than a `billable` flag on purpose: a PocketBase bool
has no unset state, so its zero value is false — naming it `non_billable` makes
the default (unset) mean *billable*, which needs no backfill, no defaulting
hook, and no per-writer discipline (every writer, including a raw API create, is
safe by construction). Billability is a property of the *labor*, not the
*ticket* — one ticket routinely mixes billable work with non-billable rework.
Reports split on it (billable = total − non_billable, plus a write-off rate) and
the customer-facing time total (below) excludes it.

Rules: read `StaffRule` (staff-only, all ops). Create requires `staff` =
self; update/delete is own-entry-or-admin. Requesters never see time entries.

### `time_sessions` — running timer (added `1811000000`)

`staff` (required), `ticket` (cascade), `visit` (→ visits, optional, no
cascade), `started_at`, `note`. A row's existence means "this agent has a
timer running" — at most **one per agent**, enforced by a unique index on
`staff`. Stopping or canceling **deletes** the row; the durable record is the
`time_entries` row that `internal/timers` mints from it on stop. So this is the
ergonomic front-end to the labor log, *not* a second ledger — it holds only the
open interval's start and never accumulates history.

`started_at` is server-stamped by the `internal/timers` create hook (any client
value is ignored), so elapsed time is trustworthy. The stop route `POST
/api/helpdesk/timers/{id}/stop` resolves the timer into a `time_entries` row —
rounding elapsed to the nearest 5 min, or taking a caller-supplied `minutes`
override — and deletes the session atomically; with `complete_visit` it also
flips the attached visit to `completed` in the same transaction (the
`internal/visits` guard then stamps `completed_at`). Minute precision is
deliberately loose — the feature is about ergonomics, not the clock.

Rules: mirror `time_entries` — read `StaffRule`, create requires `staff` =
self, update/delete own-or-admin. Requesters never see it.

### `visits` — lite dispatch (relaxed `1803000000`, extended `1804000000`)

`ticket` (cascade), `assignee` (→ staff, optional), `scheduled_at`
(optional), `status` (`requested` | `scheduled` | `completed` | `canceled`),
`location` (free text — dispatch directions; the structured site comes from
the ticket's `location` relation), `completed_at`, `notes`, `duration_minutes`
(int, optional — added `1809000000`).

`duration_minutes` is the **scheduled** block length (planned), paired with
`scheduled_at` to make a visit a real calendar block rather than a point in
time. It is deliberately distinct from **actual** labor, which lives in
`time_entries` tagged with the visit.

`assignee` and `scheduled_at` are optional at the schema level so a
`requested` visit can exist before a tech or time is known. The one invariant
— a `scheduled` visit must have **both** — is enforced by the
`internal/visits` guard hook, not the schema.

Rules: read `StaffRule || (RequesterRule && ticket.customer =
@request.auth.customer)` — a requester sees visits on their own tickets
(someone unlocks the door for the tech), but the portal never expands
`assignee`, so the MSP roster stays hidden. All writes are `StaffRule`.

### `locations` — customer places (added `1812000000`)

`customer` (required), `code` (the platform Location join key, optional —
unique per customer when set), `name` (required), `address`, `notes` (gate
codes / access directions), `contact`, `contact_phone`, `lat` / `lng`
(optional coordinates, added `1813000000`). Machine intakes resolve a payload
`location_code` per `(customer, code)` and set the ticket's `location`
relation; an unmatched code falls back to `location_note`, no auto-stub
(`docs/protocol.md`). `lat`/`lng` are set from the map picker in the Locations
detail view and back a maps "Navigate" deep link on the ticket (coordinates
preferred, `address` as fallback).

A location earns a relation where a one-off ticket visit's free-text location
did not: a project revisits the same site over weeks, so the place recurs. It
is still deliberately **not** a CMDB — a place with an address and access
notes, not an asset catalog.

Rules: read `StaffRule || (RequesterRule && customer = @request.auth.customer)`
(a requester sees their own company's sites); **create** and **update**
`StaffRule` (any agent manages sites day-to-day from the Directory — update
opened in `1813000000`); **delete** `AdminRule` (the one destructive op against
a location referenced by tickets/projects/visits).

### `projects` — installation / field-work container (added `1812000000`)

`number` (unique int, assigned by the `internal/projects` create hook),
`customer` (required), `location` (→ locations, optional), `title` (required),
`description`, `status` (`planned` | `active` | `completed` | `canceled`,
default `planned`), `start_date` / `target_date` (the target window), `lead`
(→ staff, optional — whole-rollout accountability, distinct from the
per-ticket assignees).

A project is a planning-and-grouping layer **above** the ticket → visit → time
ledger: it groups 1..N tickets (often one `install` ticket per trade, plus any
reactive tickets) and stores none of their execution data. Crew (lead ∪
ticket/visit assignees), total logged time, and total estimated effort
(`sum(ticket.estimated_minutes)`, shown as an estimated-vs-logged bar) are all
**derived** at read time via relation-hop queries on `ticket.project`, never
stored — so the project collection could be dropped and the helpdesk would
still work.

Rules: read `StaffRule || (RequesterRule && customer = @request.auth.customer)`
— a requester sees their own company's projects (the portal shows the tickets
and visits but never the `lead`/crew). create/update `StaffRule`; delete
`AdminRule`.

### Notification collections

`notification_templates`, `notification_dedupe`, `notification_send_log` —
lifted from the kiosk notifier. See `docs/notifications.md`. Two channels per
template: `enabled` (email) and `publish_nats` (publish a JSON envelope to
`helpdesk.{customerId}.events.{event_type}`, migration `1814000000`);
`notification_send_log.channel` (`email` | `nats`) records which path each row
is for.

## Idempotency & uniqueness indexes

These unique indexes are load-bearing, not just performance:

- `tickets.number` — the collision backstop for the sequential-number hook.
- `tickets.dedupe_key` (partial, `!= ''`) — absorbs NATS redelivery and
  webhook retries; a duplicate key is acked/answered without a second ticket.
- `customers.platform_org_id` (partial) — one customer per platform org.
- `customers.webhook_token` (partial) — token uniquely selects a customer.
- `customers.email_domain` (partial, `!= ''`) — a mail domain maps to one tenant.
- `ticket_comments.source_message_id` (partial, `!= ''`) — an inbound email
  `Message-ID` posts at most one comment (redelivery idempotency).
- `ticket_categories.name` / `.key` — categories are distinct; `key` is the
  stable filter/payload handle.
- `locations` (customer, code) partial (`code != ''`) — a location code is
  unique within a customer (the machine-intake join key); different customers
  may reuse a code.
- `projects.number` — the collision backstop for the project-number hook.
- `notification_dedupe` (event, ref, UTC-day) — one send per event/ref/day.
